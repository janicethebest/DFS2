<h1>Designing for Screen Assignment 2</h1>
<p>(CNN)With a career that took off in a famous zip code and was bookended all too soon in a town called Riverdale, Luke Perry had an acting career that spanned decades and touched multiple generations of television viewers.
<br>His reach can be seen in the breadth of peers and colleagues who are remembering Perry upon news of his death at age 52.
Perry died Monday after suffering what his publicist said was "a massive stroke."
From his "Beverly Hills 90210" co-stars to those who worked with him on CW's "Riverdale," Perry is being remembered as a guy as seemingly cool as the character who made him famous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica Chandler and her children had gone to the grocery store when the tornado arrived. Her boyfriend had "just enough time to dive to the couch ... and he just held onto the couch for dear life."
 <br>He suffered broken bones and puncture wounds. "We're thankful he's alive," she told CNN's Drew Griffin
  The death toll stands at 23 people, and all of them have been identified with the exception of "six (people) that could not be physically identified by sight," Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said. Officials are in the process of fingerprinting those individuals in hopes of identifying them, he said.
Three children -- ages 6, 9 and 10 -- are among those killed.
The youngest, Armando Hernandez, was remembered as "a precious little man that was loved by everyone," according to his aunt. Taylor Thornton, a fourth-grade student, was described as inquisitive and a positive influence on those around her.
As of noon Monday, there were no more people reported missing, the coroner said, but he said the tallies of dead and missing could rise as search teams make their way into new areas. Crews will be dealing with temperatures in the 30s on Tuesday morning.
The path of destruction looks "as if someone had taken a blade and just scraped the ground," Sheriff Jay Jones said.
At daybreak, emergency crews and residents witnessed more of the aftermath that Jones called "catastrophic," and the search was on for survivors and more victims. Crews are employing dogs, people, drones and "everything we can get our hands on," he told reporters.
CNN drone footage showed large swaths of flattened trees and houses reduced to a few walls or the foundation.
Stunned survivors recalled close calls and twists of fate that left them or loved ones alive.
